# Minimal Example App for BioStamp3™ Android SDK

This is a minimal example application that demonstrates how to use the
[BioStamp3™ Android SDK][1].

To run the example, build and install the app and press Scan for Sensors. The first time it is
pressed after installation you will be prompted to grant permissions. Once permissions are granted
the app will start scanning for BioStamps. Once it finds at least one, press Connect and select a
BioStamp by serial number. The app will connect to the sensor, blink the LED, and disconnect.
